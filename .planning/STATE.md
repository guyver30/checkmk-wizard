# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** A single Python-based toolchain takes a bare Checkmk install all the way to a fully onboarded, monitored network — and now also to a live, at-a-glance visual picture of that network's topology and health, without needing to duplicate Checkmk's own UI.
**Current focus:** Phase 8 - Broker Infrastructure Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 11 (Broker Infrastructure Hardening)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone: Poll Livestatus over TCP instead of Checkmk notification rules, to preserve the worker/checkmk filesystem boundary
- Milestone: Redesign MQTT contract around per-device topics (`lan/devices/{id}/...`) rather than full-blob republishes
- Milestone: Horizontal Layers build order chosen — broker (persistence + ACL from day one) → poller core → Checkmk tagging → dashboard (built last as a pure consumer)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (Poller Core) and Phase 10 (Tag-Group Integration) flagged by research as needing a live-verification research pass during planning (Livestatus diff/QoS strategy; Checkmk REST API `tag_<group_id>` attribute shape) — see .planning/research/SUMMARY.md Research Flags.
- Phase 8's read-only WS ACL was flagged by research as a critical, easy-to-retrofit-wrong risk if deferred — kept as v1 scope in this phase rather than pushed to v1.x.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Dashboard Polish | DASH2-01: Mobile-responsive layout polish | v2 | Requirements definition |
| Dashboard Polish | DASH2-02: Search/filter box on device table | v2 | Requirements definition |

## Session Continuity
