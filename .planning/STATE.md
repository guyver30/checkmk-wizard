# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** A single Python-based toolchain takes a bare Checkmk install all the way to a fully onboarded, monitored network — and now also to a live, at-a-glance visual picture of that network's topology and health, without needing to duplicate Checkmk's own UI.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — broker-infrastructure-hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (broker-infrastructure-hardening) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3 (08-01, 08-02 complete; 08-03 Tasks 1-2 done, Task 3 paused at human-verify checkpoint on real deployment host)
Status: Executing Phase 08
Last activity: 2026-09-06 -- Plan 08-03 Tasks 1-2 merged; awaiting live smoke-test verification

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone: Poll Livestatus over TCP instead of Checkmk notification rules, to preserve the worker/checkmk filesystem boundary
- Milestone: Redesign MQTT contract around per-device topics (`lan/devices/{id}/...`) rather than full-blob republishes
- Milestone: Horizontal Layers build order chosen — broker (persistence + ACL from day one) → poller core → Checkmk tagging → dashboard (built last as a pure consumer)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (Poller Core) and Phase 10 (Tag-Group Integration) flagged by research as needing a live-verification research pass during planning (Livestatus diff/QoS strategy; Checkmk REST API `tag_<group_id>` attribute shape) — see .planning/research/SUMMARY.md Research Flags.
- Phase 8's read-only WS ACL was flagged by research as a critical, easy-to-retrofit-wrong risk if deferred — kept as v1 scope in this phase rather than pushed to v1.x.
